                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>My experience working in web design is very little. At this moment in time the only code I have written has been from my bedroom whilst learning on treehouse, I definetly look forward to changing that in the future when I apply for jobs in the real world.</p>

                <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Sadly, I'm still lacking any projects to place here. But with the help of treehouse I look forward to adding some portfolio worthy projects here and becoming more familiar and experienced with front-end web development.</p>
