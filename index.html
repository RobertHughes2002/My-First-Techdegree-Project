        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As a young child, i've always loved technology and have always been fascinated by it. To be more specific I love web design and have always loved inspecting the code in the console. Now I would love to learn the skills and code it takes to become a professional front-end web developer and turn my dream into a reality.</p>
        <p>Having left school, I decided to study for a career in web design through treehouse. As a person I love to learn new skills and expand on any existing skills I may have already learned and cannot wait to start my journey as a web developer.</p>
